# RespondentPredictions
Trying to predict if someone will respond to a survey or not. 

this is for residential respodents. 

this is basically a classifications problem. 

the key is getting variables that would be available from each utility

list of desired variables.

name
age
state
city
zipcode
income
have/have not responded in the past. 
power consumption
race 
gender
household size



variables i can create
approximate home value (Zillow API) 
how long they have lived there? (maybe, idk what zillow can offer)
voting tendencies of area (red/blue)
rural/urban/suburban

crazy vars that would be cool to get
lawn color relative to neighbors (satelite data)
number of cars in driveway (satelite data)


random things that may or may not be helpful

crime rates
climate change in past years
pollution levels (may correlate to highly with urban/suburban)
